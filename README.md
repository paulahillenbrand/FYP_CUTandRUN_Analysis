**CUT&RUN Analysis - Project Information** 
This analysis aimed to identify target genes of the germ cell inducing AP2 transcription factor in Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus. 

## Acknowledgments: 
To carry out this analysis, the CUT&Tag data processing pipeline by Zheng et al (available here: https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bjk2kkye) was modified according to the eperimental differences. 

CUT&RUN data was provided by the Frank lab, University of Galway. The reference genome, GTF file and genome index files were provided by the Frank lab.

## Two files are contained in this repository:

  # FYP_CutAndRun.sh: 
This file contains all command line tools and commands used to carry out the analysis. 

  # FYP_CutAndRun.r:
This file contains all R packages and R commands used to generate plots to aid in the analysis.
